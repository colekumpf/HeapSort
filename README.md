## Overview
This repository provides code and tests that implements a Heap Sort algorithm to sort a list in **O(N*log(N)) time**. 

## Returns
The program will return a sorted list.

## Stipulations
An empty list given will return an empty list.
None list given returns None.
Duplicate entries are allowed, an will be included in the return.
The given list will not be modified after a call to heapsort.

## To run
Make sure you have python downloaded on your machine by running "python --version" in the terminal. Then run "python main_test.py" to see all the tests pass.

To run with custom input comment out the tests in main_test.py and write a line like so "print(heapsort([unsorted_list]))" to see the result of your calculation.

*MAKE SURE main.py AND main_test.py ARE IN THE SAME LOCATION.*

An example test statement would be "print(new_words([9,3,6,11,15,5,8,10]))" to which the program would return:  

[3,5,6,8,9,10,11,15]

## To Run Tests 
Run "python main_test.py".
